# Example showing all steps:

##### 1. I saved **EDMForums.xlsx** locally as **EXAMPLE_EDMForums.xlsx**

The forum **ipdfedocs** was claimed by owner 'EXAMPLE' (row 3390)

The **EDMForums** file was then uploaded to the **Uploads** folder

##### 2. From the **EDMForums** file, I generated **EXAMPLE_Documents.xlsx** in this folder

I changed the **OWNER** column so that only rows 1387 and 1403 are marked 'EXAMPLE'

The **Documents** file is again uploaded to this folder.

##### 3. From the **Documents** file, I generated **EXAMPLE_Migration.xlsx** in this folder

Look this over and see that only documents related to the band 6 cartridge and mixer test systems are included.

If this **Migration** file is submitted to the ALMA EDM Migration project team, those documents, their folder structure, and attachments will be migrated to the new ALMA EDM on Alfresco.
